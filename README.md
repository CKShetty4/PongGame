# Pong Game - Built with C++ and Raylib

Welcome to my Pong Game! This project is developed using C++ with the Raylib library and offers a classic Pong experience with several modern features. The game is designed with smooth, visually appealing graphics, using different shades of green to create a lawn-like feel.

## Features

- **Menu Screen**:
  - **Player vs Player**: Challenge a friend in a head-to-head Pong match. Player 1 controls their paddle using the `W` and `S` keys, while Player 2 uses the `Up` and `Down` arrow keys.
  - **Player vs Computer**: Take on the AI in a solo match. Control the paddle with the `Up` and `Down` arrow keys.
  - **Leaderboard**: View the highest score and the latest best score. Scores are stored in a file and persist across game sessions, ensuring you can always track your performance.
  
- **Gameplay**:
  - **Pause and Resume**: You can pause the game at any time by pressing the `Space` bar. While paused, you can choose to:
    - Resume the game by pressing `R`
    - Return to the main menu by pressing `M`
    - Quit the game by pressing `Q`
  


- **Controls**:
  - Player 1: `W` and `S` to move the paddle up and down.
  - Player 2: `Up` and `Down` arrow keys to control their paddle.
  - The `Space` bar is used to start or pause the game.

- **Score Tracking**: Scores are saved and fetched from a file, ensuring high scores are remembered across game sessions.

## Deployment

The game will also be available online via **GitHub Pages**, compiled into WebAssembly for web-based gameplay. You will be able to access the game directly in your browser through this [link](https://ckshetty4.github.io/PongGameDeploy/), which will be added upon deployment.
